I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a double degree in **‚ÄãComputer Science and Technology‚Äã and ‚ÄãEconomics and Finance‚Äã** at **Tsinghua University**.

My research interests lie broadly in **operations research and management science**, bridging theoretical rigor with real-world impact. Advised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Zijie Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/zijiezhou/), I have advanced research in ‚Äã**optimization for LLM inference**, merging traditional operations research methodologies with next-generation AI systems to deliver timely solutions. I also deeply appreciate the ‚Äãresearch mentorship‚Äã of [Prof. David Yao](https://www.columbia.edu/~yao/), [Prof. Lin William Cong](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc898/), and [Prof. Wu Zhu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1216/7050.htm), which deepened my understanding of **‚Äãtheoretical and data-driven approaches** to modeling complex dynamics and processes. Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my current work while actively exploring new frontiers‚Äî**remaining open to transformative possibilities**.

I am seeking **Ph.D. opportunities in Operations Research, Management Science, or related fields**‚Äã beginning Fall 2026. If my background aligns with your vision, I would love to connect!‚Äã‚Äã
