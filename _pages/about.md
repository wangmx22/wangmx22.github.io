I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a double degree in **​Computer Science and Technology​** and **​Economics and Finance​** at **Tsinghua University**.

My research interests lie broadly in **optimization and decision analytics**, bridging theoretical rigor with real-world impact. Advised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Zijie Zhou](https://sites.mit.edu/zijiezhou/), I have advanced research in ​**optimization for LLM inference**, merging traditional operations research methodologies with next-generation AI systems to deliver timely solutions. Throughout my undergraduate journey, I have also benefited from the guidance of [Prof. David Yao](https://www.columbia.edu/~yao/), [Prof. Lin William Cong](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc898/), and [Prof. Wu Zhu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1216/7050.htm), gaining invaluable insights into **theoretical and ​data-driven approaches for modeling complex dynamics and processes**. Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my current work while actively exploring new frontiers—**remaining open to transformative possibilities**.

I am seeking **Ph.D. opportunities in Operations Research, Management Science, or related fields**​ beginning Fall 2026. If my background aligns with your vision, I would love to connect!​​
